# Singulus

Singulus is the monolith that powers [tonyburns.net](https://tonyburns.net) and facilitates dynamic needs for me on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

This application is built first and foremost for me to [eat what I cook](https://indieweb.org/eat_what_you_cook) for my own content, but by making it open source from the beginning my hope is that it will keep me accountable and perhaps be useful to others.

## Roadmap

* [ ] [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net/) provider
* [ ] [Micropub](https://micropub.rocks/) server
* [ ] [Webmention](https://webmention.rocks/) server
* [ ] [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (POSSE)](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) for content on [tonyburns.net](https://tonyburns.net)
