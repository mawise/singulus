Singulus is the monolith that powers [tonyburns.net](https://tonyburns.net) and facilitates dynamic needs for me on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

This application is built first and foremost for me to [eat what I cook](https://indieweb.org/eat_what_you_cook) for my own content, but by making it open source from the beginning my hope is that it will keep me accountable and perhaps be useful to others.

## Features

- [x] [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net/) server built on top of [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper)
- [x] Tracking-free [URL shortening service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening) with automatic link management for other content created in Singulus
- [x] Create basic posts with categories and photos via [Micropub](https://micropub.rocks/)

- [x] OAuth 2.0 provider via [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper)
